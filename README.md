**A trivial app for storing and viewing famous quotes**

This app was specifically designed to accompany a tutorial series about modern app infrastructure. As such, I’ve done my best to make it clumsy but in a realistic way – it’s the kind of app you might build if you didn’t know better. If you’re looking for example code to learn from, this is the wrong place.
